# bluebubbles-mcp

MCP server for [BlueBubbles](https://bluebubbles.app) — access iMessage from any MCP client.

Built from scratch with no third-party MCP dependencies beyond the official [`mcp`](https://pypi.org/project/mcp/) SDK and [`httpx`](https://pypi.org/project/httpx/).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A running [BlueBubbles server](https://bluebubbles.app) with API access enabled

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metaember/bluebubbles-mcp.git
cd bluebubbles-mcp
uv sync
```

## Configuration

Add to your MCP client config (e.g. Claude Code `~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bluebubbles": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "/path/to/bluebubbles-mcp", "run", "python", "-m", "bb_mcp.server"],
      "env": {
        "BLUEBUBBLES_URL": "https://your-bluebubbles-server",
        "BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD": "your-server-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Run over HTTP (Docker)

The server speaks stdio by default. Set `MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http` to serve
over [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) instead, so any
HTTP-capable MCP client can connect at `http://<host>:8000/mcp`. The Docker image
sets this for you.

```sh
docker build -t bluebubbles-mcp .
docker run --rm -e BLUEBUBBLES_URL -e BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD -p 8000:8000 bluebubbles-mcp
```

As a Compose service — credentials live in this container's own environment (an
`env_file` or Docker secrets), so they stay isolated to this tool:

```yaml
services:
  bluebubbles-mcp:
    build: .
    environment:
      BLUEBUBBLES_URL: ${BLUEBUBBLES_URL}
      BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD: ${BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD}
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Notes:
- The HTTP endpoint is unauthenticated, so don't expose it publicly — keep it on a
  private/internal network (and drop the published `ports:` if a co-located client
  reaches it over the Compose network).
- `BLUEBUBBLES_URL` must be reachable **from inside the container** — use a
  hostname/IP the container can resolve (e.g. the BlueBubbles host's LAN address or
  `host.docker.internal`), not `localhost`.
